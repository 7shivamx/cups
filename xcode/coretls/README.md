CoreTLS Header Files
====================

The current CoreTLS header files are from the coreTLS-167 source code posted at
<https://opensource.apple.com/source/coreTLS>.

This source code has no posted license or copyright notices, but given that it
is posted on a public facing web site called "opensource.apple.com" we assume
that Apple is OK with us using these files.

We are including the header files since they are not included with the Xcode
public SDKs for macOS or iOS.  All of the header files in this directory are
Copyright Â© 2021 by Apple Inc.
